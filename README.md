# What?
[Liquid](https://modrinth.com/modpack/liquid) takes the standard collection of performance mods that players typically gather and pre-packages them into one convenient modpack, without the need of searching and downloading random mods while at it.

# Why?
whenever i like make a new instance on prism launcher, i find myself adding random mods to it whilst trying to make it;  
liquid eliminates this by just making a clear and concise simple modpack, no need to add mods to it unless you really need to
