# What?
[Liquid](https://modrinth.com/modpack/liquid) takes the standard collection of performance mods that players typically gather and pre-packages them into one convenient modpack, without the need of searching and downloading random mods while at it.

# Why?
I have created Liquid for the simple reason:  
Better Minecraft Performance on Low-end hardware

# Forge, Fabric, Quilt
Forge - No  
Fabric - Already supported  
Quilt - Probably Not (no plans for it currently)
